OpFlow is a simple process simulator written in Python, intended to assist
with operations management research. It consists of an event-driven
simulation engine managing event flow through a priority queue, and a number
of classes for easy creation of work unit, processing units, queueing and
distribution mechanisms.

A number of simple process examples are supplied demonstrating basic use of
the engine to organize processes and collect simulation stats.
